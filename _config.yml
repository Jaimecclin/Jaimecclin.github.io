  Hi, I'm Chien-Chin. It's fine if you would like to call me Jaime. Now I'm working in ASM pacific Industry as a junior software engineer.

  I am a programming lover and good at <mark>Python</mark>. I've had experience on back-end development, such as Python Flask. Language C/C++ is also in my skill sets because I am working on a semiconducting machine.
  
  Besides, I am interested in projects which apply machine learning methods on real life. Thanks for visiting my profile.
  
  This [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@leonard.cclin) collects some of my coding experince. I also share Leetcode practices in my [personal blog](https://jaimecclin.github.io/blog/).

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
